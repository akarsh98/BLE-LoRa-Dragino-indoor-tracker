In this project, we are going to discuss on how to make an Indoor Location Tracker based on LoRaWAN and BLE Technology without using GPS Technology. For this purpose we have the LBT1 LoRaWAN Indoor BLE Tracker and BLE Beacons from Dragino. Before Discussing about making the Tracker we will tear down the components and look out what is inside these modules that makes them function. BLE stands for Bluetooth Low Energy. It is a modified version of Bluetooth which consumes less power in comparison to the traditional bluetooth technology.

The BLE and LoRa based Location Tracker can be implemented succesfully in the applications where the object that is to be tracked follows a predefined path such as self driven autonomous forklifts moving in a warehouse. So what we can do is that we can add a Tracker node to the object that needs to be tracked and in the path where the object will move, we can put BLE beacons. As the beacons have a unique ID number, whenever the object comes in the range of any beacon, the tracker will send the ID to the server through a LoRaWAN Gateway and in this way, the loaction can be tracked.
